# Modelling and Control of Turbocharged SI Engine:

The objective of this project was to develop a controllable model for a Turbocharged Spark Ignition Engine. Mean value modelling approach was used for the Engine Model and a PID controller was developed using the mid-ranging control method for a coordinated control between the throttle and wastegate [TISO controller]
